# ðŸ¦  Malaria Infection Detection using Image Classification

This project demonstrates the application of deep learning for medical image classification, specifically focusing on detecting malaria infections in blood cell images. Using R with Keras and TensorFlow, we have developed a model that achieves approximately 95% accuracy in identifying parasitized cells.
